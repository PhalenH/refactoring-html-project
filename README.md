# week-1-homework

## Description

This is my week 1 homework assignment that involved refactoring a webpage. This included restructuring an already existing page to follow semantic HTML elements, ensuring all links work, adjust styling for a better user experience, adjusting the CSS file for a more consolidated and clean layout, and following the acceptance criteria provided to me.

## Finished Product

This is a screenshot of the webpage after refactoring.
